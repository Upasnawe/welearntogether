         <h2>About Pulwama Attack</h2>
        <p>
           The Pulwama attack was a tragic incident that occurred on February 14, 2019, in the Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, India. A convoy of Indian paramilitary personnel was targeted by a suicide bomber, resulting in one of the deadliest attacks in the region in recent years.

The attack targeted a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel. A suicide bomber, driving an explosive-laden vehicle, rammed into one of the buses in the convoy. The blast resulted in the loss of over 40 CRPF personnel and left many others injured. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

The Pulwama attack significantly heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, both of which have a long-standing history of conflict over the Kashmir region. The Indian government, condemning the attack, took diplomatic and military measures in response. There were calls for international condemnation of terrorism and increased pressure on Pakistan to take action against militant groups operating from its soil.

In the aftermath of the Pulwama attack, there were increased security measures, military skirmishes, and a heightened state of alert between the two neighboring countries. The incident also drew global attention to the longstanding Kashmir conflict and raised concerns about regional stability.

The international community expressed condolences for the loss of lives and called for restraint and dialogue to address the underlying issues in the region. The Pulwama attack serves as a tragic reminder of the ongoing challenges and complexities in the India-Pakistan relationship, particularly in the context of the Kashmir dispute.
